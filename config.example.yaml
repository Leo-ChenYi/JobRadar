name: "My Job Monitor"

# ============ RSS Feed Configuration ============
# How to get your RSS URL:
# 1. Login to Upwork
# 2. Go to Find Work page
# 3. Set your search filters
# 4. Click the RSS icon (usually top-right of search results)
# 5. Copy the full URL including securityToken

# Option 1: Use direct RSS URLs (recommended)
# Each URL is a complete RSS feed URL from Upwork with your auth token
rss_feeds:
  - name: "Golang Jobs"
    url: "${UPWORK_RSS_URL_1}"  # Set in environment variable
    # Or paste directly: "https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?securityToken=xxx&..."
  
  # - name: "Python Jobs"
  #   url: "${UPWORK_RSS_URL_2}"

# Option 2: Use keyword search (DEPRECATED - Upwork no longer supports public RSS)
# Only works if you have a valid base RSS URL with auth token
