  access_token: "${UPWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN}"  # Set via environment variable

# ============ Search Configurations ============
# Define what jobs to search for
# When using upwork_api, these keywords are used for API search
# When using rss_feeds, these are used for local filtering

  - name: "Golang API"
    keywords: 
      - "golang"
